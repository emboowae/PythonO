# Credit Card Validator

## Overview
This is a simple Python program designed to validate credit card numbers using the Luhn algorithm. The program does not rely on any external libraries or graphical interfaces. All input and output are handled through the terminal.

## Features
- Validates credit card numbers based on the Luhn algorithm.
- Checks for common input errors, such as non-numeric characters.
- Demonstrates basic Python programming concepts without the use of additional libraries.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- A terminal or console to run the script

## Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the script file.
2. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Run the program using the following command:
   ```bash
   python fileName.py
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python3 fileName.py
   ```
5. Follow the prompts to enter a credit card number. The program will determine if the number is valid.


## Notes
- This program validates the structure of a credit card number but does not check against any actual card issuer database.
- Input should consist only of numeric characters with no spaces or dashes.
